# Embedded Systems Architecture Handbook
topic: "Embedded Systems Architecture"
goal: |
  A comprehensive handbook covering embedded software architecture and real-time systems.

  The book should cover:
  1. Embedded SW Architecture fundamentals:
     - Bare metal vs. RTOS comparison (FreeRTOS, Zephyr, VxWorks, QNX, etc.)
     - Scheduling models: cyclic executive, event-driven, time-triggered architectures
     - Software layers: device drivers, Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL), middleware

  2. AUTOSAR Classic Architecture:
     - Runtime Environment (RTE) and Basic Software (BSW) structure
     - Software Components (SWCs) and their compositions
     - Timing concepts, runnables, and scheduling
     - Diagnostics stack (UDS, DTC) and communication stack (CAN, LIN, FlexRay, Ethernet)

  3. Real-Time Constraints:
     - Determinism and predictability requirements
     - Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET) analysis methods
     - Low-level timing design, budgeting, and verification

  4. HPC Hardware Platforms for Embedded:
     - Multi-core CPU architectures and their challenges
     - GPU computing and hardware accelerators (DSP, NPU, FPGA)
     - Memory hierarchy, caches, and memory-mapped I/O
     - Virtualization and hypervisors in embedded systems

  Focus on practical knowledge for embedded systems engineers. Include architecture diagrams, timing diagrams, and real-world examples.
