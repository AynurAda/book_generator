# Neurosymbolic AI Handbook
topic: "Neuro-symbolic AI"
goal: |
  A comprehensive handbook that bridges the gap between neural networks and symbolic AI.
  Cover the theoretical foundations, practical implementations, and cutting-edge research
  in neuro-symbolic systems. Include both the 'why' (motivation, limitations of pure approaches)
  and the 'how' (architectures, algorithms, frameworks).
